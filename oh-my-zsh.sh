# This script should be run via curl:
#   sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
# or via wget:
#   sh -c "$(wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
# or via fetch:
#   sh -c "$(fetch -o - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
#
# As an alternative, you can first download the install script and run it afterwards:
#   wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh
#   sh install.sh
#
# You can tweak the install behavior by setting variables when running the script. For
# example, to change the path to the Oh My Zsh repository:
#   ZSH=~/.zsh sh install.sh
#
# Respects the following environment variables:
#   ZSH     - path to the Oh My Zsh repository folder (default: $HOME/.oh-my-zsh)
#   REPO    - name of the GitHub repo to install from (default: ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh)
#   REMOTE  - full remote URL of the git repo to install (default: GitHub via HTTPS)
#   BRANCH  - branch to check out immediately after install (default: master)
#
# Other options:
#   CHSH       - 'no' means the installer will not change the default shell (default: yes)
#   RUNZSH     - 'no' means the installer will not run zsh after the install (default: yes)
#   KEEP_ZSHRC - 'yes' means the installer will not replace an existing .zshrc (default: no)
#
# You can also pass some arguments to the install script to set some these options:
#   --skip-chsh: has the same behavior as setting CHSH to 'no'
#   --unattended: sets both CHSH and RUNZSH to 'no'
#   --keep-zshrc: sets KEEP_ZSHRC to 'yes'
# For example:
#   sh install.sh --unattended
# or:
#   sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)" "" --unattended
